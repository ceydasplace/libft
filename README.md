# LIBFT

## Description

**libft** is the first project at 42, where the goal is to re-create a selection of standard C library functions from scratch, along with additional utility functions that will be used throughout the curriculum.

Since C is a low-level language, we often don't have access to "out-of-the-box" tools for string manipulation, memory management, or data structures. This project challenges us to understand the inner workings of these tools by building them from the ground up, following strict performance and memory guidelines.

## Library Overview

### Part 1 - Libc Functions

These functions replicate the behavior of their standard library (libc):

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ft_isalpha` | Checks if a character is alphabetic |
| `ft_isdigit` | Checks if a character is a digit |
| `ft_isalnum` | Checks if a character is alphanumeric |
| `ft_isascii` | Checks if a character is an ASCII character |
| `ft_isprint` | Checks if a character is printable |
| `ft_strlen` | Calculates the length of a string |
| `ft_memset` | Fills memory with a constant byte |
| `ft_bzero` | Sets all bytes in a memory area to zero |
| `ft_memcpy` | Copies memory area |
| `ft_memmove` | Copies memory area (handles overlapping) |
| `ft_strlcpy` | Copies string with size limitation |
| `ft_strlcat` | Concatenates strings with size limitation |
| `ft_toupper` | Converts character to uppercase |
| `ft_tolower` | Converts character to lowercase |
| `ft_strchr` | Locates first occurrence of character in string |
| `ft_strrchr` | Locates last occurrence of character in string |
| `ft_strncmp` | Compares two strings up to n characters |
| `ft_memchr` | Locates byte in memory area |
| `ft_memcmp` | Compares memory areas |
| `ft_strnstr` | Locates substring in string with length limit |
| `ft_atoi` | Converts string to integer |
| `ft_calloc` | Allocates and zeros memory |
| `ft_strdup` | Duplicates a string |

### Part 2 - Additional Functions

Custom utility functions not found in the standard library:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ft_substr` | Extracts a substring from a string |
| `ft_strjoin` | Concatenates two strings into a new one |
| `ft_strtrim` | Trims specified characters from beginning and end |
| `ft_split` | Splits a string by a delimiter into an array |
| `ft_itoa` | Converts an integer to a string |
| `ft_strmapi` | Applies a function to each character of a string |
| `ft_striteri` | Applies a function to each character with its index |
| `ft_putchar_fd` | Outputs a character to a file descriptor |
| `ft_putstr_fd` | Outputs a string to a file descriptor |
| `ft_putendl_fd` | Outputs a string with newline to a file descriptor |
| `ft_putnbr_fd` | Outputs an integer to a file descriptor |

### Part 3 - Linked List Functions

Functions for manipulating singly linked lists using `t_list` structure:

```c
typedef struct s_list
{
    void            *content;
    struct s_list   *next;
}                   t_list;
```

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ft_lstnew` | Creates a new list node |
| `ft_lstadd_front` | Adds a node at the beginning of the list |
| `ft_lstsize` | Counts the number of nodes in the list |
| `ft_lstlast` | Returns the last node of the list |
| `ft_lstadd_back` | Adds a node at the end of the list |
| `ft_lstdelone` | Deletes a single node |
| `ft_lstclear` | Deletes and frees all nodes |
| `ft_lstiter` | Applies a function to each node's content |
| `ft_lstmap` | Creates a new list by applying a function to each node |

## Instructions

### Requirements

- GCC compiler
- Make
- Unix-based operating system (Linux/macOS)

### Compilation and Make Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make` or `make all` | Compiles the library |
| `make clean` | Removes object files |
| `make fclean` | Removes object files and the library |
| `make re` | Recompiles the library from scratch |

### Usage

To use this libft library in your project:

1. Include the header file in your source code:
   ```c
   #include "libft.h"
   ```

2. Compile your program with the library:
   ```bash
   cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror your_program.c libft.a -o program
   ```

### AI Usage

While developing this project, I used AI tools as a supplemental learning resource. My goal was to treat AI like a mentor—using it to clarify the logic behind complex behaviors (such as memory overlap in memmove) or to double-check my understanding of pointer arithmetic and linked lists.

Specifically, AI was used to:
* Understand the complex behaviors and edge cases of standard library functions.
* Clarify concepts related to memory management and linked list data structures.


No code was copy-pasted. Every line of logic was written, debugged, and tested by me to ensure I fully grasp the underlying C concepts required by the 42 curriculum.
